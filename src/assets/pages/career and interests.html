        <h3>Career and interests</h3>

        <p>I am a biological scientist with an animal health background based in Brisbane, Australia. Currently, I am a scholar at the Academy of Information Technology (Coder Academy) in order to gain skills and experience in the very interesting and innovative role of becoming an IT professional.</p>
        <p>My vast postgraduate training experience in monitoring and environmental enrichment for animals used for research and teaching purposes has been very enriching. I firmly believe that having an IT qualification in combination with prior qualifications and demonstrated real world experience, will be invaluable in future IT-related roles, including academic research and developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p>
        <p>I am highly committed to being an exemplary work team member with a high degree of courtesy, ethics and professionalism. I have nurtured these attributes over the years as when working directly with research teams and other stakeholders in teaching and clinical environments.  
            With a robust background as an animal health professional and as an academic research scientist, I have gained experience in experimental design, conducting animal studies, data analysis and report writing whilst adhering to good laboratory practice standards.</p>
        <p>I have demonstrable competency in laboratory work and research duties including routine data collection, management, analysis and presentation. I have previously produced reports related to research projects and assisted in research. My postgraduate training was largely in the development and optimisation of novel laboratory techniques in plasma proteomics, for example. 
        </p>
        <p>Apart from being a Web Developer, I have other interests and hobbies. These include family engagements & activities; antique collection; homemaking; blogging; photographing signposts; writing research papers; volunteering in mentoring graduate research students; jogging, playing tennis, scrabble and darts; playing with domestic cats and walking pet dogs.</p>
        <p>Included in my resume is an outline of my experience and attributes required that will specifically prepare me for future roles.</p>
