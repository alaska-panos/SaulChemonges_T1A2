    <!-- In this section, I have introduced myselef as Saul Chemonges for the purposes of meeting T1A2 - Portfolio criteria

      Project: Planning and Developing of my Portfolio Website

    Overview

    Title: 	Portfolio Website for Saul Chemonges
    ID: 	SaulChemonges_T1A2
    Course 	Diploma of Information Technology - Bootcamp Delivery Mode
    Subject: 	INT1012 - Introduction to Web

    Introduction

    In this project as an aspiring developer, I have modelled my portfolio website in order to communicate and demonstrate my abilities to prospective employers or as an independent researcher.
    I have designed, developed and deployed a website that showcases my talent, abilities and coding experience.
    Briefly, I have created a portfolio website which presents me as a developer and IT professional. This online portfolio that provides information about me, my skills, interests, professional knowledge and a showcase of my work.
    My target audience for the portfolio website is an employer looking to engage a Web Developer and/or IT professional. I expect my future employer to have technical knowledge relating to information technology, software development/coding, programming languages and development stacks and also  high expectations of professionalism and a positive work ethic.

    Project goals

    In this project, there are into three major parts:

    - Code
    - Documentation
    - Presentation

    Code section
1: I have implemented four HTML documents which link together and share a common theme, including components to presenting the following information:
- My name and contact details
- Links to professional accounts in Github and LinkedIn
- My work, study history and a link to a my resume
- Content about me to demonstrate my personality, skills and interests
- A list of blog posts with titles and date published
- A blog with placeholders and images

2: I have created FOUR components which contain text content that are styled for my audience. I have:
- written CSS to style each component
- placed comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have included some custom styles in separate stylesheets
- used semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and website accessibility

3: There are FOUR components created using HTML and CSS to contain graphical content that are appropriate for my audience. You must:
- - written CSS to style each component
- placed comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have included some custom styles in separate stylesheets
- used semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and website accessibility

4: Here, I have created a responsive layout for each page using HTML and CSS utilising Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to produce a responsive layout that displays all components at  mobile, tablet and desktop viewport widths which includes a navigation header.
All components should:
- use valid HTML5 elements
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility 	14

Documentation summary

This project is comprised of the following: 

4.1. README document

The entire project documentation has been compiled in README.md. This file contains:

    A link (URL) to my published portfolio website
    A link to my GitHub repository
    A link to my presentation video on YouTube
    A description of my portfolio website, including,
        Purpose
        Functionality or features
        Sitemap
        Screenshots
        My target audience
        Tech stack including html, css, and deployment platform

4.2. Slide deck

I have presented the plan for my website and submitted my slides which will form the basis of a professional report.

The presentation and associated Slide deck include:

    A walk-through of my portfolio website and its features
    A walk-through of my design process and decisions
    A review of development/build process including challenges, ethical issues and favourite parts

Incorporated in the Slide deck presentation are:


5: An overview or sitemap of all the pages on my website that explains the overall structure of my website and how different pages can be navigated.

6: Wireframes of the pages of my website that map out my decision-making process relating to the overall aesthetic of my website

7: A list of components that I have used how components and styling will help in engaging with my audience

Presentation

I have made a presentation utilising material on my Slide deck that is just under 8 minutes that I have recorded and uploaded on YouTube :
Project submission

I submitted my project via Canvas as a single zip file named as SaulChemonges_T1A2.zip 

Deliverables
I have made a list of deliverables (which covers all the above requirments for this project) included in my submission. The information should be organised is a logical fashions under a sub-directory named ../term1 which conatains:
- the location of the Zip file
- README.md compiled as a single markdown file in the Root folder of my zip file
- All files linked by the README.md file are included in a folder named /docs. All resources included in this folder are be in either png, pdf or markdown (md) format. The Slide of my presesnation in pdf format are located in a /ppt folder and the Source code for my entire project is located /src folder. All links to online material have corresponding screenshots included in my submission (where applicable).

Glossary
Component - a component is a block of HTML code styled with CSS which may contain text, graphics or other content arranged aimed at a specific purpose(s), for example: a navigation bar is a component designed with the purpose of allowing a website to be navigated; a call to action component has text, a picture and a button with the purpose of calling the user to click on the button.
Semantic HTML - or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them.

            I am a Web Developer based in Brisbane, Australia

          <p> 
            Welcome to my website!
         </p>
          <p>
            I am skilled in IT-intensive discovery mass spectrometry-based proteomics on the TripleTOF 5600 (SCIEX) instrument for peptide and protein sequencing workflows. This includes the analysis of large-scale proteome-wide datasets, proteogenomics method development – plus peptide spectral library (PSL) construction using data-depended acquisition (DDA) workflows and SWATH-MS proteomic assays. As a data scientist, I collate and analyse information from massive datatabses such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), UniProt and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) using bioinfomatics tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            From begining with DOS-prompt CLI years back, I have since become proficient in using common Microsoft® Office computer applications, EndNote reference management package and bioinformatics platforms specifically SWATH pipeline (SCIEX), ProteinPilot™, Mascot, Scaffold, Skyline, PeptideShaker, PeakView® and MarkerView™ applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current career prospects as full-stack developer, are in software development and computer programming whilst building and bolstering my biomedical background, for example using acquired skills in a translational research environment, teaching, professional development whilst building research collaborations.
