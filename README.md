# Introduction

In this project as an aspiring developer, I have modelled my portfolio website in order to communicate and demonstrate my abilities to prospective employers or as an independent researcher.

I have designed, developed and deployed a website that showcases my talent, abilities and coding experience.

Briefely, I have created a portfolio website which presents me as a developer and IT professional. This online portfolio that provides information about me, my skills, interests, professional knowledge and a showcase of my work.

The arget audience for my portfolio website is an employer looking to engage a Web Developer and/or IT professional. I expect my future employer to have technical knowledge relating to information technology, software development/coding, programming languages and development stacks and high expectations of professionalism and a positive work ethic.

# Project goals

In this project, there are into three major parts:

- Code
- Documentation
- Presentation

## Code section
1: I have implemented five HTML documents which link together and share a common theme, including components to presenting the following information:
- My name and contact details
- Links to professional accounts in GitHub and LinkedIn
- My work, study history and a link to my resume
- Content about me to demonstrate my personality, skills and interests
- A list of blog posts with titles and date published
- A blog with placeholders and images

## 2: I have created FIVE components which contain text content that are styled for my audience. I have:
- written CSS to style each component
- placed comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have included some custom styles in separate stylesheets
- used semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and website accessibility

## 3: There are FIVE components created using HTML and CSS containing graphical content that are appropriate for my audience. This is what I did:
- wrote CSS to style each component
- placed comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- included some custom styles in separate stylesheets
- used semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and website accessibility

## 4: Here, I have created a responsive layout for each page using HTML and CSS utilising Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to produce a responsive layout that displays all components at mobile, tablet and desktop viewport widths which includes a navigation header.
I have used valid HTML5 semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility as displayed.

## Project submission

I submitted my project via Canvas as a single zip file named as SaulChemonges_T1A2.zip 

# Deliverables

I have made a list of deliverables (which covers all the above requirments for this project) included in my submission. The information has been organised is a logical fashions under a sub-directory named ../SaulChemonges_T1A2 which conatains:
- the location of the Zip file
- README.md compiled as a single markdown file in the Root folder of my zip file
- All files linked by the README.md file is included in a folder named /doc. All resources included in this folder are in either png, pdf or markdown (md) format. The Slide deck of my presentation in pdf format is located in /ppt folder and the Source code for my entire project is located in the /src folder.

# Glossary
Component - a component is a block of HTML code styled with CSS which may contain text, graphics or other content arranged aimed at a specific purpose(s), for example: a navigation bar is a component designed with the purpose of allowing a website to be navigated; a call-to-action component has text, a picture and a button with the purpose of calling the user to click on the button.

Semantic HTML - or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them.
